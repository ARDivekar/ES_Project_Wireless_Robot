\section{Results}

The Android \textit{Wifi hotspot} feature was used to provide a Wireless LAN which another mobile phone/computer and the rover both connect to. The connection from the rover takes about 60 seconds to detect the wifi network and connect to it.

All of the desired commands: \textit{"Forward", "Backward", "Left", "Right" \& "Stop"} worked as desired with a latency of about 1 second. 

The result of this configuration, setup and code execution was a robot which could move wirelessly using batteries. The maximum range of the robot was about 20 feet away from the user, which is about the range of the Wifi hotspot.
