\section{Implementation}

	Once we have connected the Raspberry Pi to the various hardware modules and ensured that the Raspbain Jesse installation and Django server are working, we may then proceed to create the following code files in a directory \texttt{es\_project} in the home directory of the Raspbian installation. 
	
	As a reference, in general the steps outlines in the Django tutorial \cite{DjangoTutorial} should be followed, but some files were modified by us; those changes have been reflected below.
