\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item To make a rover with basic embedded systems architecture such as wheels, motors, chassis and battery.
	
	\item To program a Django server hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 with the capability to wirelessly accept and respond to the requests \textit{"Forward", "Backward", "Left", "Right" and "Stop"} which can be sent by a human located remotely over a Wireless network.
	
	\item To provide feedback to the user from IR sensors positioned along the bottom of the rover, through a web-based interface accessible on any web-browser enabled device (Android, iOS, Windows, MacOSX and Linux).
	
	\item Learn about the challenges faced in the design and implementation of embedded systems as whole.
